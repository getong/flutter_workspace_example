# Future Cancellation Example

This Flutter project demonstrates how to work with Dart Futures and implement cancellation techniques in a well-structured, modular way.

```

## Key Components

### 1. Models (`models/task_state.dart`)
- **TaskState**: Immutable data class representing the state of an asynchronous task
- Contains status, progress, loading state, and error information
- Provides predefined states and `copyWith` method for updates

### 2. Services (`services/future_service.dart`)
- **FutureService**: Static utility class for Future operations
- Methods for simulating long-running tasks, network requests, and timers
- Demonstrates different cancellation techniques

### 3. Controllers (`controllers/future_controller.dart`)
- **FutureController**: ChangeNotifier-based controller for business logic
- Manages task state and Future operations
- Handles cancellation and cleanup
- Notifies UI of state changes

### 4. Widgets
- **FutureInfoWidget**: Displays educational information about Futures
- **TaskStatusWidget**: Shows current task status and progress
- **TaskControlsWidget**: Provides buttons for starting/canceling tasks

### 5. Screens (`screens/future_cancel_screen.dart`)
- **FutureCancelScreen**: Main screen that combines all components
- Uses the controller pattern for state management

## Future Cancellation Techniques Demonstrated

1. **Completer-based Cancellation**
   - Manual control over Future completion
   - Used for custom async operations

2. **Timer Cancellation**
   - Cancel periodic or delayed operations
   - Essential for preventing memory leaks

3. **Timeout Method**
   - Automatic cancellation after a specified duration
   - Useful for network requests and time-sensitive operations

4. **Resource Cleanup**
   - Proper disposal of resources in `dispose()` methods
   - Checking `mounted` property before UI updates

5. **State Management**
   - Using ChangeNotifier for reactive state updates
   - Separating business logic from UI code

## Running the Example

1. Ensure Flutter is installed
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Run `flutter pub get` to install dependencies
4. Run `flutter run` to start the app

## Features

- **Start Long Task**: Demonstrates a 5-second task with progress updates
- **Cancel Task**: Shows how to cancel an ongoing operation
- **Network Request**: Simulates a network call with automatic timeout
- **Progress Tracking**: Visual progress indicator during task execution
- **State Management**: Reactive UI updates based on task state changes

## Benefits of This Structure

- **Separation of Concerns**: Each component has a single responsibility
- **Testability**: Controllers and services can be easily unit tested
- **Reusability**: Widgets and services can be reused across the app
- **Maintainability**: Clear structure makes code easy to understand and modify
- **Scalability**: Architecture supports growing complexity
